GONZBEE

Gonzbee is intended to be a replacement for SABnzbd+, written in go

This project is mainly my sandbox in which I write go code. The multiple
threads of downloading, assembly of files and handling multiple concurrent
jobs, seemed like a perfect problem space to use the concurrency features in go

Note: at the moment this is just a couple of simple packages. The nzb package
handles marshalling NZB xml files into a data structure. The nntp package, is 
a simple wrapper for the nntp protocol. the yenc package is a simple yEnc
decoder which is geared towards letting the users of the package be responsible
for how they want to handle data.
