GONZBEE

Gonzbee is a command line NZB downloader, written in go

This project is mainly my sandbox in which I write go code. The multiple
threads of downloading, assembly of files and handling multiple concurrent
jobs, seemed like a perfect problem space to use the concurrency features in go

It is currently functional, but far from pleasant to use. I've been using it
myself for all my NZB downloading needs, but your mileage may vary.
